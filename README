This TYPO3 plugin adds a content element which renders specified Fluid template content. This offers many advantages over standard HTML content elements, some of the important ones:

1. Real, system generated links can be added to HTML content
2. Images can be resized within HTML
3. Anything that you can do with a Viewhelper, you can do here

Some things that this doesn't have:

1. A controller
2. A way to specify variable values

The primary purpose of this is to replace the HTML content element and its lack of flexibility.
